Chapter 11.-Uploading File using Backend

we installed two packages->
                     1. Cloudinary- where we will upload our files from local server
                     2. multer- helps us to upload files in local server.
        Now how we will do this..?
        1. We will upload the files through user using multer and keep that file temprarily on localStorage (localServer)
        2. Using Cloudinary we will take that file from the localStorage and put that file on the Cloudinary Server. 
We created a cloudinary.js files inside utils. (cloudinary.js)
   where we have written down the logic how we will upload our file from the local server to cloudinary server.

Then we created our first middlewares (multer.middleware.js)
   where we used multer and with the help of diskStorage we have wriiten down the logic how to upload our file on server.

Finally after 11 chapters we have finished our setup
