Chapter 13:- Complete guide for routers and controllers.

1. Here we created two files one for routes (user.routes.js) and controller (user.controller.js) 
2. in (controller.js) we used the async function where we declared a method for success for registerUser
3. in (routes.js) we declared the method where basically we redirected our path to /register with the help of controller.js method.
4. in (app.js) we imported and declared routes using app.use middleware 
5. Finally we check on postman whether our route is working or not.

So how the route works is... 
1. this is our path (http://localhost:8000/users)-> users.routes.js (http://localhost:8000/users/register) -> user.controller.js (we retrieve a message: "OK"/ success message).
